### Recursion
- What's the difference: Recursive Procedure VS Recursive Process VS Iterative Process?
- Write two Factorial Processes:
    1. Use Recursive Process
    2. Use Iterative Process
- What are the pros and cons? What if you tried this for Fibonacci?
- Other Topics
    - Tree Recursion
    - Order of Growth
    - Probabilistic Algorithms

### Higher order procedures
- Construct the summation of a series higher order procedure
- Other topics
    1. Procedures as general methods
    2. Procedures as return values

---
### Data Abstraction
- What is meant by data?
- Implement add-rational.

---
### Hierarchical Data
- What is the Closure Property?
- Implement functions that maps over list and maps over trees (list containing lists)
- Implement length and count-leaves
